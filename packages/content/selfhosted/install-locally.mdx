## Installing locally

Before installing, make sure you have nodejs 18.18.x installed and mysql installed. If mysql isn't installed, make sure you have it setup on the cloud and have a connection string ready.

### For Mac

Fastest way to install is by running this script inside your terminal:

<Code lang="bash" client:load>
	```
	bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operational-co/operational.co/v0.0.3/bin/setup.sh)
	```
</Code>

This will:

- make a directory(operational.co)
- git clone the repo
- Setup a .env file for /backend
- Install dependencies

After that, all you need to do is to run the commands the script will tell you to, and then visit localhost:8080 and follow the onboarding guide.

### For Windows

We don't have a terminal script. But its very easy to install.

- Git clone the repo on your machine
- cd to operational.co/backend and create an env file and add DATABASE_URL and a random SECRET env var:
<Code lang="bash" client:load>
```
DATABASE_URL="your_connection_string_here"
SECRET="any_random_string_here"
```
</Code>
- Run `npm run build`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Then cd to `../operational.co/app`
- Run `npm run buid`
- Run `npm run dev`

Then open up [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser and follow the [onboarding steps](/selfhosted/onboarding).
