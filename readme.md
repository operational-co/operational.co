## Bootstrap article

Use the article bootstrap command to create a new draft blog post and its banner assets.

Required env var:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

The command reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from `website/.env` first, then falls back to your shell environment.

Examples:

- `npm --workspace website run bootstrap-article -- --title="My Article Title"`
- `npm --workspace website run bootstrap-article -- --slug="my-article-slug"`
- `npm --workspace website run bootstrap-article -- --title="My Article Title" --slug="my-article-slug"`

What it creates:

- `website/src/content/blog/{slug}.md`
- `website/public/images/blog/{slug}/banner.png`
- `website/public/images/blog/{slug}/banner-og.jpg`

Behavior:

- If only `title` is passed, the script slugifies it and uses that for the article slug.
- If only `slug` is passed, the script de-slugs it into a readable title.
- If both are passed, the script keeps the provided title and slug.
- The article is created as a draft with starter content.
- The script stops without overwriting anything if the target article already exists.
