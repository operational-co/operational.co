## What is viewing user profile data in WooCommerce?

Viewing user profile data in WooCommerce helps you understand customer behavior.

It lets you tailor offers and improve your store.

For example, tracking when a user checks their address or account history can highlight engagement.

## Tracking profile view events in PHP

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'User Profile Viewed',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
  'content' => 'Alice Smith viewed her profile data.'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.operational.co/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: ' . 'Bearer ' . $apiKey,
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```
