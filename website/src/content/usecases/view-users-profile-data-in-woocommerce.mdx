## Understanding User Profile Data in WooCommerce

Viewing a user's profile data in your WooCommerce store helps you personalize experiences and troubleshoot account issues.

For example, you may want to log when a customer updates their address or views order history.

### Using Operational to Track Profile Views

Operational is an event tracking platform that captures structured events from any tech product.

You can use Operational to record when users view their profiles in WooCommerce and analyze these events over time.

2. Create a new workspace for your WooCommerce store.
3. Locate your API key in the workspace settings and copy it.

### Tracking Profile Views in WooCommerce

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'Profile View',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
    'content' => 'User John Smith viewed WooCommerce profile',
    'properties' => [
        'user_id' => 123,
        'display_name' => 'John Smith',
        'email' => 'john@example.com'
    ]
];

$response = $ops->events->ingest($payload);
echo 'Event sent with status: ' . $response->getStatusCode();
```

This snippet sends a profile view event to Operational whenever a customer views their WooCommerce profile.
