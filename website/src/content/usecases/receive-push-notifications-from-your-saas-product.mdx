## What are push notifications in SaaS

Push notifications let your app send real-time updates to users. They improve engagement by delivering timely alerts.

For example, you can notify a user when a payment is successful or when a task is assigned. This keeps users informed without manual checks.

### Using Operational to send push notifications

Operational is an open-source event tracking platform. It lets you record and monitor events in your app.

You can log when you send a push notification and view metrics on delivery, opens, and more.
