# Receive push notifications from your SaaS product

Sending push notifications keeps your users informed in real time. For example, you might alert a user when they receive a new message or when their subscription is about to expire. Push notifications boost engagement and help deliver a seamless user experience.

## What is Operational?

Operational is an event tracking platform for any tech product. You send events to Operational and it routes notifications across channels like push, email, or chat. You define rules on Operationalâ€™s dashboard and it handles delivery for you.

You can use Operational to trigger push notifications when key events happen in your SaaS. That way you avoid building your own notification system.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your codebase.

With your API key, you can start sending events from your app.

## Code snippet

Below is a JavaScript example showing how to send a push notification event. When a user receives a new message, Operational will deliver a push notification based on your rules.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "New message received",
  avatar: "ðŸ“¬",
  content: "Alice sent you a message"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code initializes the Operational client with your API key and ingests an event named "New message received." Operational then pushes a notification to the user based on your configured channels.

## Conclusion

Operational saves you hours of work by handling event routing and delivery for push notifications. You can focus on your core product and let Operational manage notification logic.
