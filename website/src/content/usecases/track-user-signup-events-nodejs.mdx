## What is user signup event tracking in Node.js

Tracking user signup events in a Node.js app helps you understand how users join your service.
You can measure marketing success and conversion rates.
For example, you might track when someone signs up after clicking an ad.
This lets you see which channels drive the most signups.

### Introducing Operational for event tracking

Operational is an open source tool for tracking events in any tech product.
It lets you send events from your Node.js server to a dashboard.
You can view signup counts, filter by date, and slice by user attributes.

### Setting up Operational

1. Create an account at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. In your dashboard, copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK: `npm install @operational.co/sdk`
4. Initialize the SDK with your key in your project.

### Code example: Tracking signup events

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "User Signed Up",
  avatar: "ðŸŽ‰",
  content: "New user John Smith signed up"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This snippet records a signup event each time a user called John Smith completes registration.

### Conclusion

Tracking user signups helps you measure growth and optimize your onboarding flow.
Operational saves time by handling event delivery and storage.
