## What this article covers

When a user changes their profile, you might want to notify other systems or teammates right away. In Node.js apps, sending a push notification lets you react to profile updates in real time. For example, you could alert admin dashboards or mobile apps when email or avatar changes.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool. It captures custom events from your code and delivers them to dashboards, notifications, or integrations.

You can use Operational to track profile-update events. Each event can include metadata, like which fields changed or which user made the update.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK in your Node.js app:

   npm install @operational.co/sdk

4. Use your API key in code to start sending events.

## Code example

This snippet shows how to send a push notification when a user updates their profile. It sends the user ID and which fields changed.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";
const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

async function notifyProfileUpdate(user) {
  const payload = {
    name: "Profile Updated",
    avatar: "ðŸ””",
    content: `User ${user.name} updated their profile`,
    properties: {
      userId: user.id,
      updatedFields: user.updatedFields
    }
  };

  await ops.events.ingest(payload);
}

// Example usage:
notifyProfileUpdate({
  id: "123",
  name: "John Smith",
  updatedFields: ["email", "avatar"]
});
```

This code creates an Operational event with a name, icon, message, and custom properties. It then sends it to Operational for push notifications.

## Conclusion

Using Operational to track profile updates saves time and reduces manual work. You can react to user changes immediately and power alerts in dashboards or apps.
