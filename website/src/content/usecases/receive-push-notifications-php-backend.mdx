## Why send push notifications from your PHP backend?

Push notifications let you inform users about important updates in real time.

If you run an e-commerce site, you can alert customers when their orders ship or when a sale starts.

## Using Operational to track notification events

Operational helps you record events and trigger actions from your backend.

Integrating Operational lets you send structured notification data without building your own pipeline.

## Sending push notification events with PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'push_notification_received',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ””',
    'content' => 'Order #123 has been shipped to John Doe'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code sends a push notification event to Operational when an order ships.
