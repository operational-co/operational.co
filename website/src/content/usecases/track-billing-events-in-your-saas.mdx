# What is billing event tracking in your SaaS

Billing events show when customers are charged.

Tracking these events helps you verify payments and understand revenue.

For example, logging a charge of $49 for the Pro Plan lets you reconcile accounts and spot issues.

# Track billing events with Operational

You can use Operational to send billing events to a central dashboard.

Operational stores events so you can search and analyze them later.

This improves visibility into your billing.

# Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the SDK and initialize it in your code.

# Code Example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "billing event",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "Customer John Smith was charged $49 for Pro Plan"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code logs a billing event when a customer is charged.

# Conclusion

Operational saves time by handling event tracking infrastructure.

You can focus on your product while staying informed about billing activity.
