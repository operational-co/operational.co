Copy the key and keep it safe.

You will use this key to authenticate when sending events from WordPress.

## Code example in PHP

Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` or a custom plugin.

```php
<?php
// Send a notification on new post publish
function send_operational_notification($post_id) {
  $title = get_the_title($post_id);
  $url = get_permalink($post_id);

  $payload = [
    'name' => 'New post published',
    'avatar' => '📝',
    'content' => "A new post titled \"{$title}\" was published.",
    'properties' => [
      'post_url' => $url
    ]
  ];

  $ch = curl_init('https://api.operational.co/events/ingest');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, 'YOUR_API_KEY:');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Content-Type: application/json']);
  curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);
}

add_action('publish_post', 'send_operational_notification', 10, 1);
