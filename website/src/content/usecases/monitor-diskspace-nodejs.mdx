## What is disk space monitoring in Node.js

Monitoring disk space means checking how much storage your server uses.  
This helps you prevent crashes or slowdowns.  
For example, if log files grow too large, your service may stop working.  
Tracking disk usage in your Node.js app lets you send alerts before issues occur.

### Using Operational to track disk space

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool.  
You can record custom events from your app and view them in a dashboard.  
Use Operational to record disk space events with minimal code.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for an account.  
2. Create a new project and copy the API key.  
3. Keep the API key for use in your Node.js app.

### Code example: sending disk space alerts

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Function to get disk usage percentage
function getDiskUsage() {
  // Example logic to calculate disk usage
  return 85
}

const used = getDiskUsage()

if (used > 80) {
  const payload = {
    name: "disk space low",
    avatar: "ðŸ’¾",
    content: `Server disk space at ${used}% usage`
  }

  await ops.events.ingest(payload)
}
```

This code checks disk usage and sends an alert event to Operational when usage exceeds 80%.

### Conclusion

Operational can save time by handling event storage and dashboards.  
You get alerts for disk space issues without building your own system.
