## What is cancelled subscription tracking in Node.js

Tracking cancelled subscriptions in your Node.js backend helps you understand customer churn. When a user ends their service, you can log that event to analyze trends.

For example, if Jane Doe cancels her monthly plan, you capture that action and use it to improve retention strategies.

## Using Operational to Track Events

Operational lets you send and visualize events from any tech product. You can record when subscriptions are cancelled and explore them in the dashboard.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Find your API key under project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your Node.js app:

   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```
5. Initialize the SDK with your API key in code.

## Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";
const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "subscription cancelled",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "Subscription cancelled by John Smith"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code snippet logs a cancelled subscription event to Operational.

## Conclusion

Operational can save you time and hassle by handling event tracking and visualization for cancelled subscriptions.
