## What is user signup tracking in PHP

Tracking user signup events helps you know who is joining your app.

In an ecommerce site, you can see when a new account is created.

You can use this data to measure marketing, track conversions and spot issues quickly.

### Introducing Operational for event tracking

Operational is an open source tool to collect events from any tech product.

It lets you send custom events and view them in a simple dashboard.

2. Create a new project and copy the API key.
3. In your PHP project run:

   ```bash
   composer require operational/sdk-php
   ```

4. Use your API key in code to send events.

### Tracking signup events in PHP
