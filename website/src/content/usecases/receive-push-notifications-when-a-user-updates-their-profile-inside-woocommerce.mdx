## Why send push notifications for WooCommerce profile updates

When a customer changes their profile details in your WooCommerce store, you may want to stay informed. Real-time notifications let you react quickly.

For example, if a user updates their shipping address, you can verify it before shipping their order. Or welcome them with a personalized message.

## Tracking profile updates with Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking platform. You can send custom events from your code and view them in a unified dashboard.

Use Operational to receive push notifications when profile updates happen in WooCommerce.

2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Keep your API key safe for use in your code.

## Example: sending events in PHP

```php
<?php
$apiKey = 'API_KEY';
$payload = [
  'name' => 'WooCommerce Profile Updated',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¤',
  'content' => 'User John Smith updated their profile'
];

$ch = curl_init('https://api.operational.co/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```
