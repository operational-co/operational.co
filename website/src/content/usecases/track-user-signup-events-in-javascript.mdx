## Introducing Operational

Operational is a lightweight event tracking platform.
It lets you log custom events from your app and view them in real time.
You can use it to track signups, purchases, errors, and more without heavy setup.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Keep the key handy for your JavaScript code.

## Tracking a signup event in JavaScript

Below is a simple example that logs a user signup event:

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"
const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "üéâ",
  content: "User Alice signed up with email alice@example.com"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends a "user signup" event with a celebration emoji.
You will see it appear in your Operational dashboard instantly.
