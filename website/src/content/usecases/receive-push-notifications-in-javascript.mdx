## What are push notifications in JavaScript

Push notifications let web apps send messages to users even when the page is closed.

They work through service workers and the Push API.

For example, a chat app can alert users when a new message arrives.

Handling these events in your code helps you give timely updates to your users.

## Track push events with Operational

Operational is an open-source tool to collect and view events from your app.

You can record each notification receipt and see how often users get updates.

With Operational you get a simple dashboard to filter, search, and analyze push events.

## Setting up Operational

Follow these steps to start sending events:

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and create a free account.
2. Log in and create a new project to get your API key.
3. Copy the API key from your project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your project with `npm install @operational.co/sdk`.

## Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

// Register your service worker
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
  .then(registration => {
    console.log('Service worker registered');
  });

// Listen for push events and send to Operational
navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('push', event => {
  const payload = {
    name: "push notification received",
    avatar: "ðŸ””",
    content: "New message from John Smith"
  };

  ops.events.ingest(payload);
});
```

This code registers a service worker and listens for incoming push events.
When a notification arrives, it sends an event to Operational with basic details.

## Conclusion

Using Operational to track push notifications saves time on building your own logging system.

You get a dashboard to view and filter notification events instantly.
