## What are push notifications in JavaScript?

Push notifications let web apps send messages to users even when the app is not open. They work through service workers in the browser.

For example, a chat app can notify users of new messages when they are offline.

### Using Operational to track push notification events

Operational is an open-source tool for logging events in any tech product. You can send a record each time a push notification is received.

This helps you monitor delivery rates and troubleshoot issues.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up.
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the SDK with `npm install @operational.co/sdk`.
4. Initialize the client in your code.

### Tracking push notification events

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Example service worker listener
navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener("push", event => {
  // Sample data structure: { message: "Hello from John Doe" }
  const data = event.data.json();

  ops.events.ingest({
    name: "Push notification received",
    avatar: "ðŸ””",
    content: `New message: ${data.message}`
  });
});
```

This code listens for incoming push messages and logs each one to Operational with the message content.
