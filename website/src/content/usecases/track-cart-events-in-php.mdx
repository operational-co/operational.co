## What is cart event tracking in PHP

Tracking cart events helps you see how users interact with the shopping cart. You can log when they add, remove, or checkout items.

For example, knowing which items are added most often can guide inventory decisions.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open source platform for capturing and analyzing events.

You can use its PHP SDK to send cart events with minimal code.

## Setting up Operational

1. Sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the PHP SDK using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer require operational/sdk-php
   ```
4. Add the API key to your environment or config.

## Code examples for tracking cart events

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'cart item added',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
  'content' => 'John Smith added product 123 to cart',
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

```php
<?php
$payload = [
  'name' => 'cart item removed',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
  'content' => 'John Smith removed product 456 from cart',
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

```php
<?php
$payload = [
  'name' => 'cart checked out',
  'avatar' => 'âœ…',
  'content' => 'John Smith completed checkout with order 789',
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

The above examples show how to log add, remove, and checkout actions in the cart.
