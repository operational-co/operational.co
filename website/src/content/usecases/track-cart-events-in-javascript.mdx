# Why track cart events in JavaScript

Tracking cart events helps you understand user behavior when they add or remove items. For example, you can see which products are added most often and identify drop-offs in the checkout flow.

# What is Operational

Operational is a lightweight analytics tool for capturing events in your app. You can send custom events and view them in real time to make data-driven decisions.

# Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. Sign up for a free account.
3. Create a new project.
4. Copy your API key.

# Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "product added to cart",
  avatar: "ðŸ›’",
  content: "Alice added a laptop to cart"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

The code example sends a custom "product added to cart" event whenever a user adds an item.
