## What is Operational

Operational is a simple event tracking tool. It lets you send custom events from your app. You can log actions like viewing env variables. Then you see them in a dashboard. This helps you monitor and debug with context.

## Setting up Operational

First, sign up at https://app.operational.co and create an account. After signup, get your API key from the dashboard. You will use this key to send events from your server to Operational.

## Code example

Here is a PHP snippet that reads environment variables and sends them to Operational:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$envVars = [
    'APP_ENV'      => getenv('APP_ENV'),
    'DB_HOST'      => getenv('DB_HOST'),
    'CACHE_DRIVER' => getenv('CACHE_DRIVER')
];

$contentParts = [];
foreach ($envVars as $key => $value) {
    $contentParts[] = $key . '=' . $value;
}

$content = implode(', ', $contentParts);

$payload = [
    'name'    => 'viewed environment variables',
    'avatar'  => 'ðŸ”‘',
    'content' => $content
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code loads key environment variables and tracks a custom event in Operational. It sends the env var names and values as the event content.

## Conclusion

By using Operational, you can log and monitor your server environment at any time. This helps catch misconfigurations before they cause issues. Learn more at https://operational.co. Try the playground for ready-to-use snippets: https://operational.co/playground
