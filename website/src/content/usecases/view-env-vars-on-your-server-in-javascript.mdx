## What this article covers

This article shows how to read environment variables on a JavaScript server and track them using Operational.co. Tracking env vars helps confirm critical keys are loaded.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool for any tech product. It lets you capture and view events like errors, logs, and custom actions. You can use it to track environment loads, debug server setups, and monitor key changes in real time.

## Setting up Operational

First sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co). After verifying your email, create a new project. You will see your API key in the project settings. Copy itâ€”you will need it for the code snippet below.

## Code example

Add the SDK and track your env vars on server start. The snippet reads selected values from `process.env` and sends them to Operational.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const envVars = Object.entries(process.env)
  .filter(([key]) => ["NODE_ENV", "DB_HOST"].includes(key))
  .map(([key, val]) => `${key}=${val}`)
  .join(", ");

const payload = {
  name: "environment variables loaded",
  avatar: "ðŸ”‘",
  content: `Loaded environment variables: ${envVars}`
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This example filters for `NODE_ENV` and `DB_HOST`, then sends them to your Operational project.

## Conclusion

Using Operational makes it easy to confirm your environment variables load correctly. It saves time by centralizing monitoring and helping you spot misconfigurations quickly.
