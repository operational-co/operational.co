## What is billing event tracking in PHP

Tracking billing events helps you monitor payments and invoices in your PHP application. It gives you real-time insight into customer transactions.

For example, you can log when an invoice is generated, when a payment succeeds, and when a payment fails. This helps troubleshoot issues quickly.

### What is Operational

Operational is an open-source tool for tracking events in any tech product. You can send billing events from your PHP backend to Operational and view them in a clean UI.

2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the PHP SDK by running:
   ```
   composer require operational/operational-php
   ```
4. Configure your project with the API key:
   ```php
   require 'vendor/autoload.php';

   $ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');
   ```

### Tracking billing events in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'billing_success',
  'avatar' => '💳',
  'content' => 'Invoice #12345 paid successfully by John Doe for $49.99'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code sends a billing success event to Operational with details on invoice number, payer, and amount.

### Conclusion

Operational helps you track billing events in PHP without building a custom system. It saves time and reduces errors in monitoring payments.
