## What are push notifications in Node.js?

Push notifications let your backend send messages to a user device. They can inform users about events in real time.

For example, you might notify a user when a new order is ready.

### Using Operational to track push notifications

Operational is an open source event tracking tool. It captures and displays events from your apps.

You can use it to monitor push notification events from your Node.js backend.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new workspace
4. Generate an API key
5. Copy the key for use in your code

### Code example for tracking push notifications

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "push notification sent",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "Sent push notification to user John Smith"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code tracks when your backend sends a push notification.

### Conclusion

Operational helps you see all your push notification events in one place. It saves time and boosts reliability.
