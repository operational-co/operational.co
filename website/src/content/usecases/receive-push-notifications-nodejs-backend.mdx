## What are push notifications in Node.js

Push notifications let your server send real-time messages to users. In a Node.js backend, this can inform clients about updates, alerts, or reminders.

For example, you might notify a user when a new message arrives or when a task is complete.

## Tracking push events with Operational

Operational helps you monitor and analyze events like push notifications.

You can log each notification event to see delivery rates and errors.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and create an account.
2. In your dashboard, copy the API key.
3. Install the SDK: `npm install @operational.co/sdk`.
4. Save the API key in your environment variables as `OPERATIONAL_API_KEY`.

## Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational(process.env.OPERATIONAL_API_KEY);

const payload = {
  name: "push notification received",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "Push notification sent to user John Smith"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code initializes Operational with your API key and logs a push notification event.

## Conclusion

Using Operational saves time and hassle when monitoring push notifications from your Node.js backend.
