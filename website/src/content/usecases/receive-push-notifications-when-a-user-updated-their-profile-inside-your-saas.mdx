This article shows how to send a push notification when a user updates their profile in your SaaS app. Push alerts help teams respond quickly to user changes. For example, if Jane Doe changes her email, you get an instant notification to review or verify it.

## What is Operational?

Operational is a lightweight event tracking tool. You can log important events like user actions. It collects these events and pushes them anywhere you need.

Use Operational to monitor profile updates, generate alerts, or build dashboards. It works with your existing code with minimal setup.

## Setting up Operational

1. Sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. Create a new project to get your **API key**.
3. Copy the key and save it in your code or environment.
4. Install the SDK in your project to start sending events.

## Code example: JavaScript / Node.js

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "User profile updated",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "John Smith updated their email address",
  tags: ["user_update", "profile"]
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This example sends an event when John Smith updates his email address. You can add more context or fields as needed.

## Conclusion

Using Operational saves time and reduces setup complexity. You can track user profile changes with a few lines of code. Learn more at https://operational.co.
