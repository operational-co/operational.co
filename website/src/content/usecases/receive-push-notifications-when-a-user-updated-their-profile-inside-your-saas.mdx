## Why push notifications for profile updates matter

When a user updates their profile, you want to inform other users or services in real time.

For example, a team admin can see right away when a member changes their photo or contact details.

### What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool for any tech product.

You can use it to log events and power real-time features like push notifications.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your codebase:

   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```

### Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "user profile updated",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "Alice Johnson updated their profile"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends an event to Operational whenever a user updates their profile. You can use it to trigger push notifications.

### Conclusion

Operational saves time and hassle by handling event tracking and real-time features for you.
