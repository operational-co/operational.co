## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event-tracking tool. You send it events from your apps and it delivers them as push notifications, Slack messages, and more.

Use Operational to log errors, security events, and custom actions in one place. It helps you stay on top of issues without building your own alerts system.

## Setting up Operational

1. Sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. After logging in, create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Keep your API key safe. You will use it in your WordPress setup.

## Code example

Below is a sample plugin snippet. It hooks into failed login attempts and sends an event to Operational.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: WP Suspicious Activity Alerts
 * Description: Send failed login events to Operational.
 */

function send_suspicious_login_event( $username ) {
  $api_key = 'API_KEY';
  $data = [
    'name'   => 'Suspicious login attempt',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ”’',
    'content'=> 'User john.doe had 5 failed login attempts'
  ];

  $ch = curl_init('https://api.operational.co/v2/events');
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . $api_key
  ]);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($data));
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
  curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);
}
add_action('wp_login_failed', 'send_suspicious_login_event');
```

This code listens for failed logins and posts an event to Operational. You get instant notifications and can act fast.

Setting up Operational for your WordPress site cuts down your response time. You no longer need custom scripts or manual checks.
