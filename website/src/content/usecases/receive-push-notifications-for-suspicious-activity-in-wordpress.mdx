## Why Monitor Suspicious Activity in WordPress

Monitoring suspicious activity helps you detect issues like unauthorized logins or file changes. For instance, if an outside user tries to access the admin area, you can get alerted right away.

## Tracking Suspicious Events with Operational

Operational is an event tracking platform that captures actions from your application and sends them to a dashboard or notification service. You can use it to send push alerts whenever suspicious events occur on your site.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project for your WordPress site.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the Operational PHP SDK:
   ```bash
   composer require operational/operational
   ```
5. Add your API key to your site's configuration or environment variables.

## Code Examples

Example 1: Suspicious Login Attempt

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'Suspicious login attempt',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸš¨',
  'content' => 'Multiple failed login attempts detected for user admin.'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code sends an alert when a login attempt fails more than three times.

Example 2: File Change Detected

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'Unexpected file change',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸš¨',
  'content' => 'File style.css was modified outside of approved channels.'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This snippet notifies you when a core or theme file is changed.

Example 3: Plugin Deactivation Alert

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'Plugin deactivated',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸš¨',
  'content' => 'The security plugin was deactivated by user John Smith.'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This example alerts you whenever a plugin is turned off.

## Conclusion

With Operational you can get instant push notifications for any suspicious activity on your WordPress site. It saves time and effort by sending real-time alerts and keeping all events in one place.
