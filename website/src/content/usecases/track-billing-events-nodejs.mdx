## What is billing event tracking in Node.js

Tracking billing events in your Node.js app helps you monitor payments, subscriptions, and refunds in real time. For example, you can log when a customer‚Äôs payment succeeds and alert your team on failures.

### Tracking billing events with Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool. You can use it to ingest and view billing events from your app in a single dashboard.
