## Why track suspicious activity?

Suspicious actions like multiple failed logins or unusual access can signal a security threat.
Implementing alerts helps you catch issues early.

## What is Operational and how to use it?

Operational lets you track events and send real-time alerts. You can use it to notify your team when something unusual happens.

## Setting up Operational

2. Create a new project or team.
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard.
4. Keep your API key safe; you will use it in your requests.

## Sending events with cURL

```bash
curl https://api.operational.co/events.ingest?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"name\":\"Suspicious login attempt\",\"avatar\":\"ðŸ”’\",\"content\":\"User John Smith had 5 failed login attempts from IP 192.168.0.1\"}'
```

This command sends a suspicious activity event to Operational and triggers a push notification.
