For example, you might want to know if there are multiple failed login attempts on your platform.

# 2. What is Operational?

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool for tech products. You can use it to track errors, audits, and security events.

By sending events to Operational, you get real-time notifications and a clear event history in one dashboard.

# 3. Setting up Operational

First, sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) with your email.

Once you log in, create a new project. That will give you an API key. Copy the key for the next step.

# 4. Sending events with cURL

Use cURL to post events to Operational. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your key:

```bash
curl https://api.operational.co/events.ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Suspicious login attempt",
    "avatar": "ðŸš¨",
    "content": "Multiple failed login attempts from IP 203.0.113.45"
  }'
```

This command sends a security event to Operational. You will receive a push notification when Operational ingests the event.

# 5. Conclusion

Using Operational with cURL saves time by letting you send alerts without extra code. You can see events in one place and get notified right away.
