## What is profile update notification in Node.js

When a user changes their profile it is important to let other parts of your system know.

Sending push notifications on profile updates helps keep user data in sync across services.

For example you might notify a dashboard when John Smith changes his email.

### What is Operational

Operational is an open source event tracking tool.

It lets you send events from any tech product.
