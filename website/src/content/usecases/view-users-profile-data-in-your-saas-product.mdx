## What is profile view tracking in your SaaS product

Understanding when users view their profile pages can give you insights into user engagement.

Tracking these views helps you see which users are active and how often they update or check their profiles.

You can use this data to improve user experience and tailor your product features.

### Using Operational for profile view tracking

Operational is an open source event tracking tool for your product.

You can capture custom events from any part of your app and send them to a dashboard.

This helps you centralize events and analyze user behavior more easily.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project or select an existing one in your dashboard.
3. Find your API key under project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your app. For JavaScript run:
   ```
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```
5. Initialize the SDK with your API key as shown in the code example.

### Code example: Tracking profile view events

This example shows how to send an event each time a user views their profile page.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "user_profile_viewed",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "Alice Johnson viewed her profile page"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code records a profile view event with a user name and timestamp.

### Conclusion

Tracking profile views can help you understand user engagement and improve your product.

Operational makes it easy to capture and view events in a single dashboard.
