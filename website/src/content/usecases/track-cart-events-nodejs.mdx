## What is cart event tracking in Node.js?

Tracking cart events in your Node.js application helps you understand user behavior. For example, you can log when a user adds or removes items from their cart or starts checkout processes.

### Using Operational for cart event tracking

Operational is an open source event tracking platform. It captures events from any tech product and stores them in a single place. You can use it to log cart actions and analyze them.

### Setup Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up.
2. Create a new project or workspace.
3. In the project settings, find your API key.
4. Install the SDK by running npm install @operational.co/sdk.
5. Initialize the SDK with your API key in your code.

### Code examples

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";
const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "Cart Item Added",
  avatar: "üõí",
  content: "John Smith added product 1234 to cart"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

```javascript
// Remove item from cart
const removePayload = {
  name: "Cart Item Removed",
  avatar: "üóëÔ∏è",
  content: "John Smith removed product 1234 from cart"
};

await ops.events.ingest(removePayload);
```

```javascript
// Checkout started
const checkoutPayload = {
  name: "Checkout Started",
  avatar: "üí≥",
  content: "John Smith started checkout for order 5678"
};

await ops.events.ingest(checkoutPayload);
```

These examples show how to track add, remove, and checkout events using Operational's SDK.
