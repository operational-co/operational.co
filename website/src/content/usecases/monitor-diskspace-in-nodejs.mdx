## What is disk space monitoring in Node.js

Monitoring disk space in a Node.js application means keeping track of how much storage your server uses over time. It helps you avoid full disks that can crash services or block log files.

For example, if log files grow without limit, your server can run out of space. Alerting early lets you clean up files or expand storage before users notice an outage.

## Why use Operational for monitoring

Operational is an open source event-tracking tool you can use to monitor disk space events in your Node.js apps. It collects custom events and gives you a single dashboard to view alerts and trends.

You can send events for free and set up notifications for disk usage thresholds.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your Node.js app:

   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```

## Code example: Tracking disk space events

This code shows how to send a disk space alert when usage gets high.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY")

// Check disk usage with a library or shell command
const diskUsage = 90 // percentage used on root

if (diskUsage > 80) {
  const payload = {
    name: "disk space low",
    avatar: "ðŸ’¾",
    content: `Server disk usage at ${diskUsage}% on root partition`
  }

  await ops.events.ingest(payload)
}
```

This snippet initializes the SDK with your API key. It then checks disk usage and sends an event when usage exceeds 80%.

## Conclusion

Using Operational lets you track disk space issues without building your own alert system. You get a live dashboard, history view, and notifications in minutes.
