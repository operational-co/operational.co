## Why build an audit log system in Node.js

An audit log records key actions in your app. It helps track user changes and system events for security and compliance.

For example, you can log when a user updates their profile or deletes an account. This record makes it easy to review past actions and debug issues.

## Tracking events with Operational

Operational is an open source tool to collect and view events in your app. You can send structured audit events to Operational and explore them in a web UI.

This lets you filter events, search by user, and spot unusual activity quickly.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for free.  
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.  
3. Copy your API key from the project settings.  
4. Install the SDK in your Node.js app:  
   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```

## Code examples

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "User profile update",
  avatar: "🖊️",
  content: "User John Smith updated their email address"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

```javascript
const payload = {
  name: "Account deletion",
  avatar: "🗑️",
  content: "User Alice Brown deleted their account"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

```javascript
const payload = {
  name: "Role change",
  avatar: "🔑",
  content: "Admin Michael Lee granted moderator role to user Sarah Davis"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

These examples show how to record different audit events. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and event details to fit your app.

## Conclusion

With Operational, you can build a full audit log system without extra infrastructure. It saves time and helps you meet compliance and debug needs.
