## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking service for tech products.

You can send any event data from your application to Operational.

It stores events in a central place and offers analytics over them.

## Setting up Operational

First, sign up for a free account at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).

After creating an account, get your API key from the dashboard.

Use the key in your code to authenticate requests.

## Tracking profile views in Node.js

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";
const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "view profile",
  avatar: "ðŸ‘¤",
  content: "User John Smith viewed profile",
  userId: "12345",
  userName: "John Smith"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends an event to Operational each time a user views a profile page. You can later query these events for analytics.

## Conclusion

Operational helps you track user actions like profile views without building your own system.

You can save time and focus on your product.
