## What this article covers

Tracking user signup events in your Node.js application helps you see growth and improve onboarding.

For example, an e-commerce site can monitor daily signups and tailor promotions to new users.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking platform. It captures events like signups, purchases, and errors from any app.

You can view and filter events in the dashboard or forward them to other tools for deeper analysis.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and create an account.
2. Set up a new project and copy the API key from project settings.
3. Install the SDK in your Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```

## Code snippet

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY")

const payload = {
  name: "user signup",
  avatar: "ðŸŽ‰",
  content: "New user signup: John Smith (ID 123)"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

This code initializes the SDK and sends a signup event with user details to Operational.

## Conclusion

Operational makes it quick to track events without building a custom backend.
