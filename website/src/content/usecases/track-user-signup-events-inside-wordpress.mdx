Tracking when users sign up on your WordPress site helps you understand growth and spot signup issues. You can log each new registration, tie it to campaigns, or trigger welcome flows.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking service. You can send any structured event data from your app to Operational.

It stores your events and offers a dashboard for searching, filtering, and visualizing them.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for a free account.
2. After verifying your email, create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from the project settings page. Youâ€™ll need it in your code.

## Code example: Tracking a signup in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

// Initialize SDK with your API key
$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Prepare signup event payload
$payload = [
  'name' => 'User Signed Up',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ‘¥',
  'content' => 'New user Jane Doe signed up with email jane@example.com'
];

// Send event to Operational
$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This snippet initializes Operational with your API key and sends a signup event whenever a new user registers.
