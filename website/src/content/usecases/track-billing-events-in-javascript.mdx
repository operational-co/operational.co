## What are billing events in JavaScript

Tracking billing events means capturing user actions like payments, refunds, or subscription changes.

For example, when a customer completes a payment, you can record the amount, plan, and user details.

This helps you monitor revenue, spot failed payments, and improve user support.

## Using Operational for billing events tracking

Operational is an open source tool that lets you send events from your app to a dashboard.

You can track billing events in real time and filter them by type, user, or date.

## Getting started with Operational

Follow these steps to set up Operational in your project:

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up or log in.
2. Create a new project from your dashboard.
3. In project settings, copy your API key.
4. In your app folder, run `npm install @operational.co/sdk`.
5. Import the SDK and initialize it with your API key.

## Example: Tracking billing events

This code initializes Operational and logs a billing event when a user completes a payment.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "billing_event",
  avatar: "ðŸ’°",
  content: "User John Doe completed a payment of $29.99 for subscription Pro Plan"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

## Conclusion

Operational saves time by handling event delivery and storage for you.

You can focus on coding while it records all billing events reliably.
