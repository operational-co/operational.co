## What this article covers

Tracking billing events in your app helps you monitor revenue and spot payment issues quickly. For example, you can log every successful charge, failed payment, or subscription change. That gives you clear visibility into your transaction flow. It helps support teams respond faster when a payment fails.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open source event tracking solution that helps you capture and view events in your product. You can use it to record billing events and see them in a dashboard. Every event you send shows up instantly. You can search and filter by event name or metadata.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and create a free account.
2. Copy your API key from the settings page.
3. Install the SDK in your project and use the key to initialize it.

## Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

async function trackBillingEvents() {
  await ops.events.ingest({
    name: "charge.success",
    avatar: "💳",
    content: "Customer Jane Doe completed a $29.99 charge"
  });

  await ops.events.ingest({
    name: "charge.failed",
    avatar: "❌",
    content: "Payment of $49.99 failed for customer John Smith"
  });

  await ops.events.ingest({
    name: "subscription.updated",
    avatar: "🔄",
    content: "Customer Jane Doe upgraded to Pro plan"
  });
}

trackBillingEvents();
```
