## What is billing event tracking in JavaScript

Tracking billing events helps you monitor revenue and user subscriptions.

When a user buys a plan or renews a subscription, logging that event lets you analyze revenue and user behavior.

For example, you might record when a customer upgrades from free to pro.

### What is Operational and how to use it for billing events

Operational is an open-source tool for event tracking.

It lets you send structured events from your application to a dashboard.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Copy your API key from project settings.
4. Install the SDK in your JavaScript app.

### Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "billing_success",
  avatar: "ðŸ’³",
  content: "Subscription plan upgraded to Pro for $49/month"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This snippet logs a billing_success event with details about the subscription event.

### Conclusion

Tracking billing events helps you understand revenue flow and user upgrades.

Operational makes it easy to log and analyze these events.
