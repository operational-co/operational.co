## What is subscription cancellation tracking in PHP

Tracking when users cancel helps you understand churn and improve retention. In a SaaS app, cancellations signal pain points.

For example, if a user cancels after a billing error, you can reach out to fix the issue and win them back.

## Using Operational to track cancellations

Operational is an event tracking platform for any tech product. You can log events without hosting your own analytics stack.

You send a simple payload and Operational captures, stores, and lets you explore it instantly.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. Copy the project API key from settings.
4. Install the PHP SDK: `composer require operational/sdk-php`.

## Code example in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name' => 'subscription cancelled',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸš«',
  'content' => 'User John Smith cancelled their subscription'
];

$ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This code sends a "subscription cancelled" event with user details to Operational.

## Conclusion

Tracking cancellations helps you reduce churn and improve your product. Operational makes it simple to log and explore events.
