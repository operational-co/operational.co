## What is Operational?

Operational is an event tracking tool for any tech product. You can log structured events like subscription cancellations.

It captures event details and user properties. This helps you analyze and reduce churn.

## Setting up Operational

First, sign up at https://app.operational.co and log in.

Copy your API key from the dashboard.

Install the PHP SDK in your project. Then you are ready to send events.

## Code example

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Operational\\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
    'name' => 'subscription cancelled',
    'avatar' => 'ðŸ›‘',
    'content' => 'User John Doe cancelled their subscription',
    'properties' => [
        'user_id' => 12345,
        'plan' => 'Pro',
        'cancelled_at' => '2025-05-22T10:00:00Z'
    ],
];

$response = $ops->events->ingest($payload);

echo "Event sent with ID: {$response['id']}";
```

This code initializes the SDK, builds a payload, and sends a "subscription cancelled" event.

## Conclusion

Tracking cancellations with Operational lets you spot churn fast. It saves you time by handling event logging.
