## What is Operational?

Operational is an open source event tracking tool.
It lets you send custom events from any app.
You can view, filter, and query events in a simple dashboard.

## Setting up Operational

First, sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
Copy your API key from the dashboard.
You will use this key to send events from your JavaScript code.

## Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "subscription cancelled",
  avatar: "ðŸ””",
  content: "User Jane Doe cancelled subscription 1234"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends an event when a user cancels their subscription.
You can customize the name, avatar, and content fields.

## Conclusion

Operational makes it easy to track subscription cancellations.
You save time building analytics from scratch.
