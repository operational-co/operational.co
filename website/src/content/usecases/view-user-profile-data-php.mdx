## What this article covers

Viewing user profile data in your PHP app helps you understand user behavior and improve personalization. For example, you can track when Jane Doe updates her profile and respond with targeted messages.

## What is Operational

Operational is an open-source event tracking tool. It lets you send custom events like "viewed_profile" to a central dashboard. You get real-time insights without building complex infrastructure.

Use events to monitor user actions, measure feature adoption, and debug issues faster.

## Setting up Operational

1. Sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. Create a new project and copy your API key.
3. Install the PHP SDK via Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require operational/sdk
   ```

4. Keep your API key handy for the code snippet below.

## Code example

Here's how to send a "viewed_profile" event when a user checks another user's profile. This snippet uses the Operational PHP SDK.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\SDK;

// Initialize with your API key
$ops = new SDK('API_KEY');

// Prepare the event payload
$payload = [
  'name'       => 'viewed_profile',
  'avatar'     => 'ðŸ‘¤',
  'content'    => "Jane Doe's profile viewed",
  'properties' => [
    'user_id'    => 123,
    'user_name'  => 'Jane Doe',
    'membership' => 'Pro'
  ]
];

// Send the event
$response = $ops->events->ingest($payload);

// Check the response
if ($response->getStatusCode() === 200) {
  echo "Event sent successfully.";
}
```

This code initializes the SDK, builds an event payload with user details, and sends it to Operational.

## Conclusion

With Operational, you skip building your own analytics backend. You get instant insights into profile views and other events. It saves you time and reduces maintenance.
