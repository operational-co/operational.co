# What is an audit log in PHP

An audit log records key actions and changes in your application.

In a PHP app you might log when a user updates their profile or an admin deletes a record.

That history helps you track who did what and when.

# Why use Operational for audit logs

Operational is a simple event tracking service.

You send it events from your code and it stores them for you.

You can view, filter, and search audit events in its dashboard.

# Setup Operational

Follow these steps to start sending events:

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up.
2. Create a new project in your dashboard.
3. In project settings, copy your API key.
4. Install the PHP SDK with Composer:
   ```bash
   composer require operational/operational-php
   ```

# Code examples

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\Operational;

$ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

// 1. User created
$ops->events->ingest([
  'name' => 'user.created',
  'avatar' => '🎉',
  'content' => 'User John Smith created a new account',
  'properties' => [
    'userId' => 123
  ]
]);

// 2. User updated profile
$ops->events->ingest([
  'name' => 'user.updated',
  'avatar' => '✏️',
  'content' => 'User Jane Doe changed password',
  'properties' => [
    'userId' => 456,
    'field' => 'password'
  ]
]);

// 3. Record deleted by admin
$ops->events->ingest([
  'name' => 'record.deleted',
  'avatar' => '🗑️',
  'content' => 'Admin Mike Lee deleted order #789',
  'properties' => [
    'adminId' => 12,
    'orderId' => 789
  ]
]);
```

The examples show how to send different audit events to Operational.

# Conclusion

With Operational you get a ready-made audit log without building a database schema or UI.
