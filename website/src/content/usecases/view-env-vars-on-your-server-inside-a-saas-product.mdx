## What is viewing environment variables in a SaaS dashboard

Viewing environment variables inside a SaaS dashboard helps you audit and debug your applications.

For example, you might need to confirm that the DATABASE_URL value is correct after a deployment.

Tracking each view gives your team visibility into who accessed sensitive configuration settings.

## Using Operational to track views

Operational lets you log events like viewing environment variables in your SaaS product.

You can send event data in real time and review it in a clean interface.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up or log in.
2. Create a new workspace and get your API key.
3. Install the SDK with npm:

   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```
4. Initialize the SDK in your code:

   ```js
   import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";
   const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");
   ```

## Code snippet

```js
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";
const ops = new Operational("API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "view environment variables",
  avatar: "ðŸ”‘",
  content: "Alice viewed environment variables on production server"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code sends an event when a user views environment variables.

## Conclusion

Operational saves you time by handling event tracking and storage.
