## What is cronjob monitoring in SaaS

Scheduled tasks or cronjobs run at set times to perform important work like sending reports or cleaning data. When one of these tasks fails or runs late, it can cause delays or missed deadlines.

Monitoring cronjobs helps you catch failures, errors, and slow runs. For example, if a nightly billing job fails, you can alert on that immediately and avoid revenue issues.

## Using Operational to monitor cronjobs

Operational is an event tracking tool that ingests and visualizes custom events from your application. You can send events for successful runs, errors, or warnings from your cronjobs. 

This gives you a dashboard of cronjob health and history.

## Setting up Operational

To start sending events from your cronjobs:

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up or log in.
2. In your workspace, navigate to API Keys under settings.
3. Create a new API key and give it a name like ‚ÄúCronjob Monitor Key.‚Äù
4. Copy the API key; you will use it in your code.

## Code examples

Here are examples of tracking cronjob events in Node.js using the Operational SDK.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY")

// 1. Successful run event
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob completed",
  avatar: "üïí",
  content: "Daily report job finished successfully for user Jane Doe"
})

// 2. Failure event
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob failed",
  avatar: "‚ùå",
  content: "Invoice generation job failed for order 12345"
})

// 3. Delay warning event
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob delayed",
  avatar: "‚ö†Ô∏è",
  content: "Cleanup task took longer than expected: 120 seconds"
})
```

These examples show how to send different event types for your scheduled tasks. You can customize the `name`, `avatar`, and `content` to suit your needs.

## Conclusion

Operational makes it easy to track and visualize cronjob outcomes. You can spot failures or delays in real time and respond faster.
