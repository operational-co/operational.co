## What is cronjob monitoring in SaaS

Cronjobs run tasks on a schedule in your SaaS app. They can generate reports, clean data, or send notifications.

Monitoring these jobs helps you spot failures fast. You see if a nightly backup fails or a report takes too long.

For example, a daily data sync that stops working can lead to stale information for your users.

Tracking cronjobs makes sure you fix issues before they affect customers.

### Using Operational for cronjob tracking

Operational is a simple event tracking service. You can send events on job success, failure, or duration.

It collects data and shows it in a dashboard. You can set alerts when jobs fail or slow down.

### Setting up Operational

1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project or workspace for your SaaS app.
3. In the project settings, copy your API key.
4. Install the SDK in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install @operational.co/sdk
   ```
5. Paste your API key into your code to start sending events.

### Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY")

// Success event example
const payload = {
  name: "cronjob success",
  avatar: "‚úÖ",
  content: "Daily report job completed in 15 seconds"
}

await ops.events.ingest(payload)
```

The above example sends a success event for a daily report job. You can see it in the Operational dashboard.

```javascript
// Failure event example
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob failure",
  avatar: "‚ùå",
  content: "Daily report job failed due to timeout"
})

// Slow job alert example
await ops.events.ingest({
  name: "cronjob slow",
  avatar: "üê¢",
  content: "Daily report job took 300 seconds, exceeding threshold"
})
```

These examples show how to track failures and performance issues.
