## What this article is about

Running cronjobs in Node.js is common for tasks like sending emails or cleaning up data.

Tracking their success and failure helps you catch issues early.

For example, you might automate daily reports but miss errors in the job.

## What is Operational?

Operational is a simple event tracking platform.

You can send custom events for anything in your tech product.

It helps you monitor jobs, errors, or user actions.

You view events in a dashboard or set up alerts.

## Setting up Operational

First, sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).

After you confirm your email, go to the API keys section.

Copy your API key and keep it safe.

You will use this key to send events from your Node.js app.

## Code snippet

This example shows how to send a cronjob event to Operational.

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk"

const ops = new Operational("API_KEY")

async function trackCronJob() {
  const payload = {
    name: "cronjob execution",
    avatar: "⏰",
    content: "Daily report job completed successfully by system"
  }

  await ops.events.ingest(payload)
}

trackCronJob()
```

This code logs a cronjob run. Replace API_KEY with the key from your dashboard. The payload fields set the event name, icon, and description.

## Conclusion

Operational saves you time by collecting cronjob metrics in one place.

You can spot failures, measure runtimes, and improve reliability.
