## What this article covers

## What is Operational?

Operational is an open-source event tracking service that helps you capture and stream events from any tech product. You can track notifications, errors, user actions, and more.

By sending events to Operational, you get a unified dashboard and real-time alerts wherever you work.

## Setting up Operational

1. Sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co).
2. After verifying your email, go to the API keys section in your project settings.
3. Copy your API key â€“ youâ€™ll use it to authenticate cURL requests.

## Sending push notification events with cURL

Use the following cURL command to send a push notification event to Operational:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.operational.co/v1/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "push notification delivered",
    "avatar": "ðŸ””",
    "content": "Sent push notification to Jane Doe"
  }'
```

This example sends an event named "push notification delivered" with an alert emoji and a message indicating who received the notification.

## Conclusion

Using Operational with cURL saves time and reduces complexity when tracking push notifications. You get instant visibility and alerts without building your own infrastructure.
