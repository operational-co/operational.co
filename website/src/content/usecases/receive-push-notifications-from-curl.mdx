## Why use cURL for push notifications

Receiving push notifications can help you test and debug event streams in your application.

Using cURL gives you a fast way to catch incoming events without writing extra code.

For example, you can verify that your payment service sends notifications correctly by sending them to a local endpoint and inspecting the payload.

## Sending events with cURL

This example shows how to send a push notification event to Operational using cURL.

```bash
curl https://api.operational.co/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "push notification received",
    "avatar": "üîî",
    "content": "Received a push notification from Stripe"
  }'
