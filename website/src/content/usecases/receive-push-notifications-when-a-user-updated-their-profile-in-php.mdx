## What is profile update notification in PHP?

Sending real-time push notifications when a user updates their profile helps you track user actions.

For example, you can get notified when John Smith changes his email address.

### Using Operational for notifications

2. Create a new project in the dashboard.
3. Find your API key under project settings.
4. Install the PHP SDK with composer:
   ```
   composer require operational/operational-php
   ```
5. Copy your API key for use in your code.

### Tracking profile updates in PHP

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Operational\\Operational;

$ops = new Operational('YOUR_API_KEY');

$payload = [
  'name'    => 'user_profile_updated',
  'avatar'  => 'ðŸ””',
  'content' => 'John Smith updated their profile information',
];

$response = $ops->events->ingest($payload);
```

This example sends an event to Operational when a user updates their profile. The event name is `user_profile_updated` and it includes a simple message.
