## Why monitor disk space in SaaS

Monitoring disk space in your SaaS application helps you avoid downtime and data loss.  
For example, if your server is running out of storage, you can get alerts before it impacts users.

## Tracking disk usage with Operational

Operational is a lightweight event tracking platform.  
You can send custom events to monitor metrics like disk usage over time.

## Setting up Operational

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for a free account.  
2. In your dashboard, navigate to API Keys and create a new key.  
3. Copy the API key for your project.

## Code example

```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "Low disk space alert",
  avatar: "💾",
  content: "Server alpha has 5% disk space remaining"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```

This code initializes the Operational client and sends a disk space alert event.

## Conclusion

Using Operational lets you set up disk space monitoring with minimal code.  
You get real-time alerts and an easy way to visualize storage metrics.
