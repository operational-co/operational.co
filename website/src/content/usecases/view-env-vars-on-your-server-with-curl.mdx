# View env vars on your server with cURL

## What this article is about

Viewing environment variables directly on your server helps with debugging and configuration checks.

## What is Operational

Operational is an event tracking tool for your tech stack.

You can log custom events like env var views and monitor them in real time.

## Setting up Operational

Sign up at [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and get your API key.

You'll use this key to authenticate when sending events from your server.

## Track env var views with cURL

Here's a cURL command to fetch your env vars and send an event:

```bash
# Fetch env vars
curl http://your-server.com/api/env

# Send event to Operational
curl https://api.operational.co/v1/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Viewed environment variables",
    "avatar": "üåê",
    "content": "Fetched environment variables list on server"
  }'
```

This example first hits your `/api/env` endpoint, then logs the view event to Operational.

## Conclusion

Operational saves time by capturing these access events without extra setup.
