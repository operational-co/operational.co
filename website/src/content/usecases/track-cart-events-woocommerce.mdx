## Why Track Cart Events in WooCommerce

Tracking cart events helps you understand user behavior before checkout. You can see when users add or remove items.

This data can highlight friction points and reduce cart abandonment. For example, if many users remove high-priced items, you might offer discounts.

## Operational for Ecommerce Event Tracking

Operational is an open-source event tracking platform that captures actions like cart updates. You can send events from WooCommerce to see live data in one dashboard.

## Setup Operational for WooCommerce

1. Go to https://app.operational.co and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project for your WooCommerce store.
3. Copy the API key from your project settings.

## Integrate WooCommerce with Operational

```php
<?php
// Replace with your actual API key
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Prepare the event payload
$payload = [
  'name' => 'Cart Updated',
  'avatar' => 'ðŸ›’',
  'content' => 'User updated cart with 3 items totaling $150.00',
  'properties' => [
    'cart_id' => 456,
    'items_count' => 3,
    'total' => 150.00
  ],
  'user_id' => 789
];

// Send the event to Operational API
$ch = curl_init('https://api.operational.co/v1/events');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  'Content-Type: application/json',
  'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($payload));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
```

The code above sends a cart updated event with details such as cart ID, item count, and total value to Operational.
