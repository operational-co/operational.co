## What is Operational
Operational is an open-source platform for tracking events in your applications.
It lets you send custom events like disk usage alerts and view them in a dashboard.

## Setting up Operational
1. Go to [app.operational.co](https://app.operational.co) and sign up.
2. After login, get your API key from the workspace settings.
3. Keep the key handy to send events from your code.

## Code example
```javascript
import Operational from "@operational.co/sdk";

const ops = new Operational("YOUR_API_KEY");

const payload = {
  name: "disk space low",
  avatar: "ðŸ’¾",
  content: "Disk usage at 92% on production server"
};

await ops.events.ingest(payload);
```
This code sends a diskspace warning event to Operational with details about the server usage.

## Conclusion
Using Operational saves you time and hassle by handling event tracking and alerts.
